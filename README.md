Landlord and Tenant Housing communication app
  
Description  
This project is about helping tenants connect more freely and efficiently with landlords or estate agents. Currently the endless options of communication can leave both parties confused or feeling like they have not been heard properly or ignored when important information is exchanged. The information itself can get lost via email or forgotten to be written down in a more formal way from phone conversations. This application aims to bring together all communication into one environment.
